# Routing-Algorithms-Dijkstra-s-algorithm-and-edge-disjoint-paths
**Description:** this assignment was implemented in the Computer Communications and Networks course (ITCS6166/8166 - Fall 2016). The purpose of the assignment is to implement Dijkstra algorithm and the shortest edge-disjoint paths in a graph. The full description of the assignment can be found in "Assignment description.pdf". Also, there are powerpoint slide describing the algorithms.

**Language used:** Java 

**Repository Structure:**

 - **Assignment description:** please check “Assignment description.pdf”.
 - **Part 1:** includes the implementations of the standard Dijkstra's
   algorithm for finding shortest paths from a given source node to a
   given destination node in graphs.
 - **Part 2:** includes the implementation to find the shortest pair of
   edge-disjoint paths in a graph, from a given source node to a given
   destination node
 - **Slides:** powerpoint slides explaining the algorithms.
 - **Test Files:** text files including hypothetical graphs for testing

**How to run:**

 - Locate the test graph file in the project directory and name it
   "graph.txt". Please refer to the “Assignment description.pdf” for the
   file format
 - Execute the application
 - Enter the source node
 - Enter the destination node.
